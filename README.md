# Greenhouse-Controller-Pi4
A Greenhouse Controller displays real-time sensor data for temperature, humidity, and pressure. Readings appear on-screen as a thermostat and on a Raspberry Pi as a bar graph. Three green bars show the current temperature, humidity, and pressure, while purple squares indicate target setpoints for temperature and humidity.
